MCFontMap is a library for use with Apple's SpriteKit for using FontMaps.

Currently the only FontMaps supported are those created by bmGlyph (Send example font map if you want that kind supported)

The two formats ar the Sparrow XML format and the Cocos2d newline delimited format

Included is an example font package named "MilitaryFont.fntpkg"

Currently the library requires fonts to be packaged this way.

A folder with the file extension .fntpkg and the same name as that of the .fnt and .png files included within.
